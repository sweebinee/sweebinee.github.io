# Overview
> The tumor microenvironment is a cellular niche composed of neoplastic and non-neoplastic cells. Components of the latter include hematopoetic (immune) cells that serve as sentinels that patrol most anatomical environments within the host and serve to alert and respond to perturbations in homeostasis. Meanwhile, tumors are fittingly adaptable to the patrolling and effector functions of hematopoetic cells, and via multiple cellular and molecular responses, can reduce their vulnerability to death and clearance by the immune system. As such, a scenario of “survival of the fittest” is established.
